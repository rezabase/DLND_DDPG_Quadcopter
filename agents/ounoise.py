''' Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Noise

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein–Uhlenbeck_process

We'll use a specific noise process that has some desired properties, called the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. It essentially generates random samples from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, but each sample affects the next one such that two consecutive samples are more likely to be closer together than further apart. In this sense, the process in Markovian in nature.

Why is this relevant to us? We could just sample from Gaussian distribution, couldn't we? Yes, but remember that we want to use this process to add some noise to our actions, in order to encourage exploratory behavior. And since our actions translate to force and torque being applied to a quadcopter, we want consecutive actions to not vary wildly. Otherwise, we may not actually get anywhere! Imagine flicking a controller up-down, left-right randomly!

Besides the temporally correlated nature of samples, the other nice thing about the OU process is that it tends to settle down close to the specified mean over time. When used to generate noise, we can specify a mean of zero, and that will have the effect of reducing exploration as we make progress on learning the task.

Here is a sample implementation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that you can use.
